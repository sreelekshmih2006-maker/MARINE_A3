# MARINE_A3
MARINE-A³ is an autonomous marine safety node that continuously monitors human presence, boat condition, and environmental risk factors. It automatically detects emergencies and issues alerts even when fishermen are unable to manually communicate, offering a low-cost, practical alternative to traditional communication-dependent safety systems.
