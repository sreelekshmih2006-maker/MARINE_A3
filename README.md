# MARINE-A³

**Autonomous, Aware, Always-On Marine Safety System**

MARINE-A³ is a single-board intelligent marine safety system designed to improve safety for small-scale fishermen operating beyond cellular coverage.

---

## Problem

Small fishing boats often operate in regions without reliable mobile network coverage. In emergency situations such as capsizing, heat stress, or sudden storms, fishermen may be unable to manually call for help.

Existing solutions like satellite phones are expensive, manual, and ineffective if the user is incapacitated.

---

## Solution

MARINE-A³ provides continuous, autonomous safety monitoring by:

- Detecting emergencies automatically
- Monitoring fisherman presence and boat condition
- Issuing alerts without requiring user interaction
- Using opportunistic wireless communication when available

The system prioritizes safety outcomes over continuous connectivity.
