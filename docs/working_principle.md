## Working Principle

1. Sensors continuously monitor fisherman presence, boat stability, and environment.
2. Data is processed locally on the Vega board.
3. Decision logic evaluates risk conditions.
4. If risk thresholds are exceeded:
   - Local alerts are activated.
   - Emergency signals are transmitted opportunistically.
5. System continues monitoring until reset.
