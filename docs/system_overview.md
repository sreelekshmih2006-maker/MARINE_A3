## System Overview

MARINE-A³ is a self-contained safety node installed on a fishing boat. The system continuously monitors human presence, boat condition, and environmental parameters.

When abnormal conditions are detected, MARINE-A³ escalates alerts locally and attempts wireless notification when connectivity is available.
