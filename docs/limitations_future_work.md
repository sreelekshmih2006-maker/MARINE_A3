## Limitations

- Communication range is limited in the prototype.
- System effectiveness depends on available relay infrastructure.
- Marine-grade hardware hardening is not included.

## Future Work

- Integration with floating relay buoys
- Long-range low-power radio support
- Satellite-assisted backhaul
- Fleet-level data aggregation
